# Digital Mirror

Lightweight p5.js generative portrait for exhibition.

Files
- `art.js` — main p5.js sketch that captures webcam and renders squiggly lines.
- `style.css` — UI and layout styles for the canvas and controllers.
- `index.html` — entry page that loads p5.js and the sketch.

Quick start (local)
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. Allow webcam access when prompted.

Preparing for GitHub
1. Initialize a git repo and commit (this project already contains a local commit if you followed setup):
   - `git init -b main`
   - `git add .`
   - `git commit -m "Initial commit: Digital Mirror"`
2. Create a GitHub repo and follow instructions to push (add remote and push).

Privacy note
- This sketch requests webcam access; do not commit any recorded video or sensitive files.

If you want, I can add a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy this as a static site (GitHub Pages).
